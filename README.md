## Supporting Developers 
If you use this a lot or want to see it improve consider giving it a star or  becoming a [githup sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/HansUXdev/). 

I author does **a lot more** than just publishing a json file for snippets.

Here are just a few things he's working on, while taking care of his ðŸ‘¶ as a full-time single father, job hunting & competing in hackathons...

### Educational Repos
Trigger | Description & Info
--- | ---
[JavaScript-First](https://github.com/HansUXdev/JavaScript-First) | An Open Source Book that teaches anyone how to code with JavaScript using the node.js runtime environment rather than a browser and by the end, you will build a server and a website using JavaScript..
[Learn Mongo GitPod](https://github.com/HansUXdev/LearnMongoGitPod)| A repo designed to teach mongoDB to people with zero experiance and zero config, meaning you can learn on virtually any device that has a browser that GitPod can run on! This ðŸ¤žmayðŸ¤ž become part of Free Code Camp [[1](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-is-new-content-created-at-fcc/416191/3)], [[2](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/103)].

### Future Snippets & Extensions
Name | Description
--- | ---
Code Slides | A snippet extension for creating educational slides with [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) and a custom theme. (not public yet)
Foundation 6 Snippets| This will start as a snippets for [sites](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and then be updated for [email](https://get.foundation/emails). If sponsored, I will extend this to eventually replace the [CLI](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-cli) and [building blocks](https://get.foundation/building-blocks/) by implementing a custom feature that writes install kits in a similar way the [web boilerplate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesqquick.web-boilerplate) writes an html, css, and js file.  (not started yet)

### Social Entrepreneurship: Open Source Non-Profit
I'm in the process of founding a non-profit dedicated to promoting open source by doing the following and can only commit to the first two without proper sponsorship:
Name | Description
--- | ---
Creating open source curriculum | Getting open source curriculum into the hands for high school students.
CTE Coding Students | Bringing industry professionals into the class room to inspire them (via zoom). I already did this as a teacher by bringing people from Riot Games / Carvana, Choice Hotels, Auth0, and many others into my classroom. Now I want to streamline this for more schools.
Free Coding Classes on Twitch | I stream open source classes for an introductory javaScript class every week to test the open source curriculum I write. Think of it as a free bootcamp online. I also despritely need a better computer that doesn't require iced gel packs to be able to stream ðŸ˜….... 
Lobbying for Open Source Certification | When I taught in a public CTE high school, I couldn't believe that a multiple choice test like th MTA certifications were approved by the state over open source certifications such as Free Code Camp's. I know enough school board members and a few house members to help get the ball rolling but, it's a lot of leg work and I don't want to commit to this without funding...
Laptop | Donating 4G latops/tablets to students struggling with remote academic life. Having taught a few students with bad internet, etc, this is especially important to me but I don't have the resources to address this without funding.
