The first, (currently only) and hands down BEST bootstrap 5 snippet extension. Includes templates, powerful utility snippets, and much more.


# Open Source Marketplace
This may surprizes you but VS Code and it's marketplace isn't really open source and is licensed under a not-FLOSS license and contains telemetry/tracking, [read more...](https://vscodium.com/)

This extension is built for [open-vsx](https://open-vsx.org/) and published on the ONLY [open source registry](https://open-vsx.org/about) for VS Code extensions.

If you are reading this, it's because I opened sourced it. Hopefully you love open source as much as me...

Don't share this code comment with anyone. It'll be our little inside joke.

Wanna conduct an expirment together?
1. Give this extension 5 stars. Write an awesome review.
2. Share it and promote it on social media, twitter, facebook, linkedin, etc... 
3. Lets see if we can get ~20-100k downloads.
4. Just as people are getting hooked, I'll uncomment the text below. 
    Then remove the extension from the stor at a random time to raise awareness about open source.
    If you are a publisher of an extension, or snippet, you do the same thing.

## Notes
Bootstrap 5 is currently in alpha and this extension does not implement all the component yet (see the todo list below).

Unlike a lot of other snippets, this extension aims to balence user simplicity, with power and flexibility by keeping the **total number of snippets to a minimum**. 

In terms of **user simplicity**, other Bootstrap 4 snippets have 5 different snippets for the grid, whereas this will have 3, but each is more powerful.

## Roadmap
* v1.5 - Each snippet with eventually have a gif demo (soon).
* v2 - All base [templates](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) and several others will be one tab away, so consider  [sponsoring this](https://github.com/sponsors/HansUXdev/) or giving it a star.

## Supporting Developers 
If you use this a lot or want to see it improve consider giving it a star or  becoming a [githup sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/HansUXdev/). 

I author does **a lot more** than just publishing a json file for snippets.

Here are just a few things he's working on, while taking care of his ðŸ‘¶ as a full-time single father, job hunting & competing in hackathons...

### Educational Repos
Trigger | Description & Info
--- | ---
[JavaScript-First](https://github.com/HansUXdev/JavaScript-First) | An Open Source Book that teaches anyone how to code with JavaScript using the node.js runtime environment rather than a browser and by the end, you will build a server and a website using JavaScript..
[Learn Mongo GitPod](https://github.com/HansUXdev/LearnMongoGitPod)| A repo designed to teach mongoDB to people with zero experiance and zero config, meaning you can learn on virtually any device that has a browser that GitPod can run on! This ðŸ¤žmayðŸ¤ž become part of Free Code Camp [[1](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-is-new-content-created-at-fcc/416191/3)], [[2](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/103)].


### Future Snippets & Extensions
Name | Description
--- | ---
[JavaScript-First]()  | JavaScript First is a huge collection of snippets useful for working with JS--based servers, browsers, databases and more. It is also meant to be paired with the book, [JavaScript-First](https://github.com/HansUXdev/JavaScript-First).
Foundation 6 Snippets| This will start as a snippets for [sites](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and then be updated for.
Code Slides | A snippet extension for creating educational slides with [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) and a custom theme. (not public yet)
Foundation 6 Snippets| This will start as a snippets for [sites](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and then be updated for.[email](https://get.foundation/emails). If sponsored, I will extend this to eventually replace the [CLI](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-cli) and [building blocks](https://get.foundation/building-blocks/) by implementing a custom feature that writes install kits in a similar way the [web boilerplate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesqquick.web-boilerplate) writes an html, css, and js file.  (not started yet)

### Social Entrepreneurship: Open Source Non-Profit
I'm in the process of founding a non-profit dedicated to promoting open source by doing the following and can only commit to the first two without proper sponsorship:
Name | Description
--- | ---
Creating open source curriculum | Getting open source curriculum into the hands for high school students.
CTE Coding Students | Bringing industry professionals into the class room to inspire them (via zoom). I already did this as a teacher by bringing people from Riot Games / Carvana, Choice Hotels, Auth0, and many others into my classroom. Now I want to streamline this for more schools.
Free Coding Classes on Twitch | I stream open source classes for an introductory javaScript class every week to test the open source curriculum I write. Think of it as a free bootcamp online. I also despritely need a better computer that doesn't require iced gel packs to be able to stream ðŸ˜….... 
Lobbying for Open Source Certification | When I taught in a public CTE high school, I couldn't believe that a multiple choice test like th MTA certifications were approved by the state over open source certifications such as Free Code Camp's. I know enough school board members and a few house members to help get the ball rolling but, it's a lot of leg work and I don't want to commit to this without funding...
Laptop | Donating 4G latops/tablets to students struggling with remote academic life. Having taught a few students with bad internet, etc, this is especially important to me but I don't have the resources to address this without funding.
